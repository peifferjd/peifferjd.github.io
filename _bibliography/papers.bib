	abstract = {Video and wearable sensor data provide comple-mentary information about human movement. Video provides a holistic understanding of the entire body in the world while wearable sensors, namely inertial measurement units ({IMUs}), provide high-resolution measurements of specific body segments. A robust method to fuse these modalities and obtain biomechanically accurate kinematics would have substantial utility for clinical assessment and monitoring. Although multiple video-sensor fusion methods exist, most assume that a time-intensive and often brittle sensor-body calibration process has already been completed. In this work, we employ an implicit function to combine handheld smartphone video and uncalibrated {IMU} data at their full temporal resolution. Our monocular, video-only, biomechanical reconstruction already performs well, with only 3.91 (1.55) degrees of mean adjusted angular error in knee kinematics across 60 recordings. Re-constructing from a fusion of video and {IMU} data reduces this error to 2.9 (1.27) degrees. We validate this method in a diverse group including individuals with no gait impairments, lower limb prosthesis users, and those with a history of stroke. We also show that {IMU} data allows accurate tracking through periods of visual occlusion, equivalent to video-only.},
