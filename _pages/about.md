<!-- Hi there! I'm J.D., a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. I work with a great team at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab at the intersection of AI and medicine, leveraging modern machine learning approaches to improve diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation.

A problem with motion capture is that it is either not accessible or not intrepretible. My main focus is developing algorithms to reconstruct movement captured from a handheld smartphone video using biomechanically grounded models. This is a complicated problem as most existing algorithms do not consider biomechanics nor a moving camera.

I also have my irons in a number of other fires: validating our approach on the upper extremity with collaborators, thinking of ways to intrepret the high quality data we collect, and deploying our technology to actual clinics. -->

Hi there! I'm J.D., a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. I’m fortunate to work with an incredible team at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, where we operate at the intersection of AI and medicine, using cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.

 My primary focus is on developing algorithms to reconstruct human movement from handheld smartphone videos using biomechanically grounded models. This is a complex problem, as most existing methods fail to account for biomechanics or the challenges of working with a moving camera.

Beyond my main work, I’m involved in several exciting projects: collaborating to validate our approach on upper extremity movement, exploring innovative ways to interpret the high-quality data we collect, and working to deploy our technology in real clinical settings.
