	abstract = {Video and wearable sensor data provide comple-mentary information about human movement. Video provides a holistic understanding of the entire body in the world while wearable sensors, namely inertial measurement units ({IMUs}), provide high-resolution measurements of specific body segments. A robust method to fuse these modalities and obtain biomechanically accurate kinematics would have substantial utility for clinical assessment and monitoring. Although multiple video-sensor fusion methods exist, most assume that a time-intensive and often brittle sensor-body calibration process has already been completed. In this work, we employ an implicit function to combine handheld smartphone video and uncalibrated {IMU} data at their full temporal resolution. Our monocular, video-only, biomechanical reconstruction already performs well, with only 3.91 (1.55) degrees of mean adjusted angular error in knee kinematics across 60 recordings. Re-constructing from a fusion of video and {IMU} data reduces this error to 2.9 (1.27) degrees. We validate this method in a diverse group including individuals with no gait impairments, lower limb prosthesis users, and those with a history of stroke. We also show that {IMU} data allows accurate tracking through periods of visual occlusion, equivalent to video-only.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
The current clinical standard for functional imaging of patients with lung ailments is nuclear medicine scintigraphy and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ({SPECT}) which detect the gamma decay of inhaled radioactive tracers. Hyperpolarized ({HP}) Xenon-129 {MRI} ({XeMRI}) of the lungs has recently been {FDA} approved and provides similar functional images of the lungs with higher spatial resolution than scintigraphy and {SPECT}. Here we compare Technetium-99m (99mTc) diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate scintigraphy and {SPECT} with {HP} {XeMRI} in healthy controls, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ({COPD}) patients.
Materials and Methods
59 subjects, healthy, with asthma, and with {COPD}, underwent 99mTc scintigraphy/{SPECT}, standard spirometry, and {HP} {XeMRI}. {XeMRI} and {SPECT} images were registered for direct voxel-wise signal comparisons. Images were also compared using ventilation defect percentage ({VDP}), and a standard 6-compartment method. {VDP} calculated from {XeMRI} and {SPECT} images was compared to spirometry.
Results
Median Pearson correlation coefficient for voxel-wise signal comparison was 0.698 (0.613–0.782) between scintigraphy and {XeMRI} and 0.398 (0.286–0.502) between {SPECT} and {XeMRI}. Correlation between {VDP} measures was r = 0.853, p {\textless} 0.05. {VDP} separated asthma and {COPD} from the control group and was significantly correlated with {FEV}1, {FEV}1/{FVC}, and {FEF} 25–75.
Conclusion
{HP} {XeMRI} provides equivalent information to 99mTc {SPECT} and standard spirometry measures. Additionally, {XeMRI} is non-invasive, hence it could be used for longitudinal studies for evaluating emerging treatment for lung ailments.},
